We present raw experiment data for each forest site. First column indicates plot code with A for open plots and F for closed plots. The pair column indicates the pair each plot belongs to. The treatment column indicates if each plot correspond to Control treatment (open) or simulating defaunation treatment (closed). All subsequent columns present abundance data for each taxa present in the experiment.
